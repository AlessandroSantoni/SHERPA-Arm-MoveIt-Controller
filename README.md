# SHERPA-Arm-MoveIt-Controller

This work is part of my BSc-Thesis. 

Download find-object ROS package on your own. Then replace the files I attach here. 
In particular, 
  _ Create directory "saved_objs" in the root of the package
  _ Place the two launch files in "/launch/" folder
  _ Replace the .cpp source file inside "/src/ros/"
  
Please find the attached "Appendix A" to have guidance on how to make it work.

I want to thank my supervisor Mohsen for the help!
