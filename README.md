# SHERPA-Arm-MoveIt-Controller

This work is part of my BSc-Thesis. 

Download find-object ROS package on your own. Then add the files I attach here. 

In particular, 

  _ Create directory "saved_objs" in the root of the package

  _ Place the two launch files in the "/launch/" folder
  

Please find the attached "Appendix A" to have guidance on how to make it work.
