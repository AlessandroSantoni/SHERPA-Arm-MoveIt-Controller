# SHERPA-Arm-MoveIt-Controller

This work is part of my BSc-Thesis. 

In addition to the files directly provided, download the find-object ROS package on your own and make the following modifications : 

  _ Create the directory "saved_objs" in the root of the package

  _ Place the two launch files given in this repo (in the find-obj section) in the "/launch/" folder of the same pkg above
  

Please find the attached "Appendix A" to have guidance on how to make it work.
